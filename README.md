## Notes

This app runs using the Twitter developer API and shows further progress in creating Home feed pages and utilizing http calls to receive and display data.
Data is transferred between activities as parcelables, enabled easily using the Parceler library.
The app also uses Room, an ORM SQLite database, to keep ten preloaded tweets for offline viewing (persistence). This is enabled through the use of Data Access Objects (DAOs).

## Open-source libraries used
